        Authentication level:
        It is the assemble of binary mask code.
        The 1st bit: It shows whether to enable verifying dynamic signature code
                     (1 to enable and 0 to disable).
                     The dynamic signature code is to make each authentication
                     packet different.
                     If the dynamic signature code in packet is bigger than
                     which center server saved, it is available and center server
                     will update its saved value with which in packet. 
 
        The 2nd bit: It shows whether to enable verifying user's IP address
                     (1 to enable and 0 to disable).
                     In common situation, user's IP address saved both by login
                     server and game server should be the same and needn't verify.
                     If you want to take strict authentication,
                     it should be enabled.
                     
        eg:
        Authentication level 0
            verify dynamic signature code: no
            verify IP Address: no 
        Authentication level 1
            verify dynamic signature code: yes
            verify IP Address: no 
        Authentication level 2
            verify dynamic signature code: no
            verify IP Address: yes 
        Authentication level 3
            verify dynamic signature code: yes
            verify IP Address: yes
